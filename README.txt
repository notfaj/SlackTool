Please don't pester me if there's a bug. I have some people as dedicated testers to help weed out some user error issues, they usually catch most bugs.

Tutorial:
To run, be sure all your wiz clients are ordered correctly (p2 should be below and to the right of p1, etc), and all logged into the desired wizard. 
Run the SlackTool.exe by double clicking it. Pay attention to the blue text on the window that shows up, as it will tell you when the program is ready after lauching.

From here, it's very self explanatory. Look in SlackTool-config.ini to see what hotkeys are mapped. Refer to the discord server's reference channel for proper key names, they are case sensitive.

To remap keys, simply replace the key's name with the desired key in the config. Save your changes, then kill (with the kill hotkey) and relaunch the tool.

To force a version, turn auto updating off in the config and set the current version to the desired version. Save and relaunch. Keep in mind the version must actually exist on the SlackTool github.

This tool gets updated when I have free time from college, and my personal project(s). Don't pester me for when updates are coming.

What hotkeys exist:
  -X Press to all clients
  -Spacebar press to all clients
  -Sync XYZ of all clients (syncs with selected client)
  -Navmap quest TP (selected client)
  -Navmap quest TP for all clients. Which client the teleport obeys varies depending on the scenario.
